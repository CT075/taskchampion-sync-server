TaskChampion Sync-Server
------------------------

TaskChampion is the task database [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior) uses to store and sync tasks.
This repository implements a sync server against which Taskwarrior and other applications embedding TaskChampion can sync.

## Status

This repository was spun off from Taskwarrior itself after the 3.0.0 release.
It is still under development and currently best described as a reference implementation of the Taskchampion sync protocol.
