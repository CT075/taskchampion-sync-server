# Development Guide

This repository is a typical Rust application.
To work on it, you'll need to [install a recent version of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (the latest stable is always a good choice).
Once you've done that, run `cargo build` at the top level of this repository to build the binary.
Alternately, run `cargo test` to run the test suite.

## Making a Pull Request

We expect contributors to follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
Aside from that, we have no particular requirements on pull requests.
Make your patch, double-check that it's complete (tests? docs? documentation comments?), and make a new pull request.
